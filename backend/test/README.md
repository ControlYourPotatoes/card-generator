## Phase 1: DI Foundation Tests ✅

### Package: `pkg/di`

- **Coverage**: 93.0%
- **Tests**: 13 test functions + 3 benchmarks
- **Features Tested**:
  - Container creation and initialization
  - Service registration (singleton and transient)
  - Service resolution and type safety
  - Factory function validation
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Lifecycle management (Clear)

### Package: `pkg/config`

- **Coverage**: 75.8%
- **Tests**: 12 test functions
- **Features Tested**:
  - Default configuration loading
  - YAML file configuration override
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Configuration validation
  - Database connection string generation
  - Configuration priority (env > yaml > defaults)

### Package: `pkg/bootstrap`

- **Coverage**: 72.7%
- **Tests**: 15 test functions
- **Features Tested**:
  - Application initialization and dependency wiring
  - Service resolution through the application
  - Configuration injection
  - Storage type registration
  - Singleton vs transient behavior
  - Graceful application shutdown

## Phase 2: Integration Tests ✅

### Package: `test/integration`

- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Current Tests**:
  - Application bootstrap integration
  - Configuration integration
  - Component resolution chain
- **Planned**: Error handling, performance characteristics

## Phase 3: End-to-End Tests ✅

### Package: `test/e2e`

- **Purpose**: Test complete workflows from input to output
- **Current Tests**:
  - Complete card generation workflow foundation
- **Planned**: CLI integration, configuration variations, error scenarios

## Test Commands

### Basic Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run end-to-end tests
make test-e2e

# Test specific package
make test-pkg PKG=di
```

### Coverage and Quality

```bash
# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage

# Run benchmarks
make test-benchmark

# Format and vet code
make quality

# Full development workflow
make dev

# CI pipeline
make ci
```

### Advanced Testing

```bash
# Verbose output
make test-verbose

# Clean test artifacts
make clean-test

# Format all code (including problematic files)
make fmt-all

# Vet all code (including problematic files)
make vet-all
```

## Test Data

Test data is stored in `backend/test/testdata/` and includes:

- `test_cards.csv`: Basic test cards for unit tests
- `anthem_cards.csv`: Anthem-type cards for integration tests
- `artifact.csv`: Artifact cards for type-specific tests
- `incantation.csv`: Incantation cards for workflow tests

## Coverage Reports

After running `make test-coverage`, coverage reports are available at:

- Terminal: Inline coverage percentages
- HTML: `backend/coverage.html` (detailed line-by-line coverage)

## Performance Benchmarks

The DI container includes performance benchmarks:

- `BenchmarkRegisterSingleton`: ~53 ns/op
- `BenchmarkResolve`: ~5.5 ns/op (cached singletons)
- `BenchmarkResolveTransient`: ~187 ns/op (new instances)

## Quality Checks

The quality pipeline includes:

1. **Formatting**: `go fmt` on all packages
2. **Static Analysis**: `go vet` for common issues
3. **Unit Tests**: All foundation package tests
4. **Coverage**: Minimum coverage tracking

## Test Organization Principles

### Unit Tests

- Located alongside the code they test (`*_test.go`)
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1s total)

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Verify dependency injection works correctly
- Test configuration flows
- Validate error propagation

### End-to-End Tests

- Test complete user workflows
- Verify CLI tool functionality
- Test with real data files
- Performance and stress testing

## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline (`make ci`) runs:

1. Code formatting and static analysis
2. Unit tests with coverage reporting
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Integration and E2E test foundation

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Expansion

- [ ] Error handling integration tests
- [ ] Performance integration tests
- [ ] Cross-component data flow tests
- [ ] Configuration change propagation tests

### Phase 3 Expansion

- [ ] CLI tool integration tests
- [ ] Large dataset performance tests
- [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] Multiple configuration environment tests

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Test data generation utilities
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Test result reporting and metrics
- [ ] Automated test discovery

## Running Tests in Development

For efficient development, use:

```bash
# Quick feedback loop
make test-unit

# Before committing
make dev

# Full validation
make ci
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Empty .go files**: Run the cleanup to remove empty files causing formatting errors
2. **Import issues**: Some legacy code has import path issues - use scoped targets (`pkg/...`)
3. **Test data**: Ensure test data is copied with `make generate-testdata`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Verbose test output
make test-verbose

# Clean and retry
make clean-test && make test

# Test specific functionality
make test-pkg PKG=di
```
