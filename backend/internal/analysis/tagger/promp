ok, questions, for the tagger engine, i noticed we also have a type folder, would it be benefitial to use the types package to set any definitions that will be shared from card, like a middle man for the entire tagger part. 

I am curious if thats something that should be done or its better for it directly import the definitions from cards. The reason i mainly ask this is due to this error say something about to many call and it made me took its actually called a lot but i may be reeding into since i am unsure if thats what it means
