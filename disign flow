This design follows several important principles:

Separation of Concerns:

Card types and validation (types.go)
Data structure and conversion (card.go)
Storage interface and implementation (store.go)


Interface-based Design:

CardStore interface allows different storage implementations
Card interface defines common behavior


Factory Pattern:

CardFactory handles creation of different card types
Ensures proper initialization and validation


Data Persistence:

CardData struct for serialization
JSON support built-in
Extensible for other formats


Thread Safety:

Mutex-protected operations in store
Safe for concurrent access

The main package I've provided shows how to bridge the components together. Here's what it does:

Initializes the memory store
Creates a card factory
Sets up a parser for the input file
Processes cards through the pipeline:

Parse CSV → Create CardData → Factory creates Card → Store saves Card



To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

Add error handling for edge cases in the parser
Implement proper logging
Add configuration management
Consider implementing a file-based store
Add CLI commands for different operations (create, read, update, delete)
